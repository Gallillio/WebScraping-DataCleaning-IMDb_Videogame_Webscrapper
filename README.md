# WebScrapping and DataCleaning: IMDb_Videogame_Webscrapper

I use python web scrapping on IMDb's collection of videogames to collect data about Thousands of games. The user will be able to filter through the games to find 
the perfect videogame for them, by filtering through details such as actors in game, the maturity rating of the game, the release date, and the genre.


IMPORTANT NOTE: 
1) Please when you run the app, make sure to STOP RUNNING the code within a few seconds, as the code will continue to run until its done with all the pages.
It has to loop through 33,545 titles which can take a long time.
2) If you wish, you can rerun the code and it will go scrap the website again and update the dataframe incase new games have been added since the creation of this project.
